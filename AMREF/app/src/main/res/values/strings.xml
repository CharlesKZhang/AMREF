    <string name="disclaimer"><b>Disclaimer:</b> This is not the actual HELP application, but rather
        it demonstrates how a learner would interact with HELP on a basic mobile phone.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_partners">Partners</string>
    <string name="partnersInfo">The HELP partnership is a cross-sector partnership of Amref Health
        Africa, Safaricom, Mezzanine, M-Pesa Foundation, and Accenture Development Partnerships

    <string name="title_activity_pedagody">Pedagogy</string>
    <string name="pedagogyInfo1">       Help has defined a one-of-a-kind mobile learning approach, based on
        learning best-practices.</string>
    <string name="pedagogyInfo2">        Right pace, rhythm and tools for mLearning. </string>
    <string name="pedagogyInfo3">        Two way communication and support for Long Lasting Professional Development.</string>
    <string name="pedagogyInfo4">        The optimal HELP mLearning solution is a balanced act between Pedagogy, Content,

    <string name="title_activity_features">Features</string>
    <string name="feature1">The platform provides a number of powerful features including:</string>
    <string name="feature2"><b>Structured Learning</b>- the “mPedagogy” applies advanced learning principles
        and approaches to basic mobile channels in a combination of “patterns” that aim to simulate
        the learning experience and outcomes from traditional in-person training methods, such as
        through role plays, job aids, quizzes and games, etc.</string>
    <string name="feature3"><b>Collaboration</b> - allowing community units to share knowledge, provide
        one another with support and communicate directly with supervisors.</string>
    <string name="feature4"><b>Monitoring</b> - weekly reports on CHV performance are sent directly to CHVs
    and their supervisors, and progress statistics are available to the HELP team. CHVs who are
    struggling can be contacted by the HELP team to provide encouragement and support.</string>
    <string name="feature5"><b>Support</b> - CHVs also have access to a dedicated, toll free help desk that
        can help them with any challenges.</string>
